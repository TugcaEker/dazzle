## Description

TODO

## Requirements

* PHP-5.6 or PHP-7.0+,
* UNIX or Windows OS,
* Additional constraints based on which components you do plan to use.

## Installation

Dazzle components can be installed separately, allowing you to build your own technology stack. To install any of them, simply visit their repositories and follow the installation instructions posted there. Some of the packages can be used instantly with event minimal configuration of PHP, some require additional libraries.

## Versioning

Versioning of Dazzle libraries is being shared between all packages included in [Dazzle Project](https://github.com/dazzle-php/dazzle). That means the releases are being made concurrently for all of them. On one hand this might lead to "empty" releases for some packages at times, but don't worry. In the end it is far much easier for contributors to maintain and -- what's the most important -- much more straight-forward for users to understand the compatibility and inter-operability of the packages.
