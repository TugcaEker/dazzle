## Description

Dazzle Project is an open-source movement and a set of libraries designed specially for the purpose of allowing developers to write non-blocking, asynchronous code in PHP. Dazzle provides a variety of straight-forward, yet powerful components to ensure the implementation of such architecture will be possible in any application easily and rapidly. The project aims to create the complete asynchronous, environment with all the tools necessary to build working applications from the scratch. All of the packages included are interoperable with each other, secure, effective and efficient. Each package is provided with a set of working examples, tests and well-formed documentation on at least minimum required level.

## Components

Dazzle is a set of libraries meaning that each component can be required by your application indepentently. The current releases provides following packages:

## Requirements

* PHP-5.6 or PHP-7.0+,
* UNIX or Windows OS,
* Additional constraints based on which components you do plan to use.

## Installation

Dazzle components can be installed separately, allowing you to build your own technology stack. To install any of them, simply visit their repositories and follow the installation instructions posted there. Some of the packages can be used instantly with event minimal configuration of PHP, some require additional libraries.

## Versioning

Versioning of Dazzle libraries is being shared between all packages included in [Dazzle Project](https://github.com/dazzle-php/dazzle). That means the releases are being made concurrently for all of them. On one hand this might lead to "empty" releases for some packages at times, but don't worry. In the end it is far much easier for contributors to maintain and -- what's the most important -- much more straight-forward for users to understand the compatibility and inter-operability of the packages.

## Contributing

Thank you for considering contributing to Dazzle Project! To contribue visit the repository of the package you would like to introduce changes to, read the attached contributing guide and create PR. To contribute with the new, non-existing repository, contact author directly using the information provided in [composer.json](https://github.com/dazzle-php/dazzle/blob/master/composer.json) file.

## Going Further

Whenever you feel your projects using Dazzle start to become huge and complicated you might find yourself in a need of a tool that provides more possibilites than library can. If that happens, don't worry and try the [Kraken Framework](https://github.com/kraken-php/framework). It is fully asynchronous and distributed framework working on top of dazzle libraries that was created to contain most of the boilerplate and implement solutions which you need when creating services and service-oriented applications.
